    "text": "Academic Integrity Code\nAcademic dishonesty is defined as cheating of any kind, including misrepresenting one’s own work, taking credit for the work of others without crediting them and without appropriate authorization, and the fabrication of information. You are not allowed to collaborate on the home works and lab assignments; for programming projects and hardware lab assignments, you can work in teams only if they are designated as team projects (labs). Unless otherwise specified, you cannot search for solutions or code on the web – but you can use any code that is included in the textbook or lecture notes (but please cite them). I will be using a SW tool that checks for program code similarities – any pair of programs or written reports with greater than 10% similarity will be closely examined.\nThe Office of Academic Integrity maintains a permanent record of the violation. More information is available from the Office of Academic Integrity at https://studentconduct.gwu.edu/academic-integrity.

My journey began in India, where I completed my undergraduate studies at the Symbiosis Institute of Technology. It was during these formative years that I developed a keen interest in all things tech.\nBefore embarking on my graduate studies at GWU, I had the incredible opportunity to work as both a Data Scientist intern and a DevOps intern for a dynamic startup. These experiences not only honed my skills but also fueled my curiosity to explore the ever-evolving tech landscape.\nBut it’s not all about screens and keyboards. I’m an avid sports enthusiast, and cricket holds a special place in my heart. There’s nothing quite like the thrill of a good cricket match. And when I’m looking to break a sweat and enjoy some friendly competition, you might catch me on the volleyball court, spiking and setting with the folks at Volo.\nIn addition to my academic pursuits, I take on the responsibility of maintaining the CS1010 course website. It’s a role that I take seriously, as I believe that a well-structured online platform is essential for enhancing the learning experience of fellow students.\nSo, whether it’s coding, sports, or web maintenance, I’m always up for a challenge. Feel free to reach out, and let’s embark on this exciting journey together!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a Quarto website.

    "text": "Running your First Program\n\n\nIn the world of programming, an editor is more than just a text processor. It’s your creative workspace where you bring your code to life. Here are some key aspects of code editors:\n\nText Editing: At its core, an editor allows you to write, edit, and organize code in various programming languages. It provides features like syntax highlighting, auto-indentation, and code completion to enhance your coding experience.\nCode Execution: Some editors, like Jupyter Notebook, not only allow you to write code but also execute it in an interactive and step-by-step manner. This is especially useful for data analysis and experimentation.\nExtensions and Plugins: Code editors are highly customizable. You can enhance their functionality by installing extensions or plugins tailored to your needs.

    "text": "In the world of programming, an editor is more than just a text processor. It’s your creative workspace where you bring your code to life. Here are some key aspects of code editors:\n\nText Editing: At its core, an editor allows you to write, edit, and organize code in various programming languages. It provides features like syntax highlighting, auto-indentation, and code completion to enhance your coding experience.\nCode Execution: Some editors, like Jupyter Notebook, not only allow you to write code but also execute it in an interactive and step-by-step manner. This is especially useful for data analysis and experimentation.\nExtensions and Plugins: Code editors are highly customizable.
