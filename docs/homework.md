## Introduction

In this guide, you will learn how to launch a local Jupyter server using
Anaconda Navigator and open an HW1 file from your download folder. Make
sure you have Anaconda installed on your computer before proceeding.

### Step 1: Open Anaconda Navigator

1.  Search for "Anaconda Navigator" in your computer's applications or
    start menu.

2.  Click on "Anaconda Navigator" to open it.

### Step 2: Launch Jupyter Notebook

1.  In Anaconda Navigator, locate the "Jupyter Notebook" tile and click
    the "Launch" button next to it.

2.  This will open a terminal window, and the Jupyter server will start.

### Step 3: Access Jupyter Dashboard

1.  After the Jupyter server has started, your default web browser will
    open with the Jupyter Dashboard. This dashboard is a web-based
    interface to your Jupyter environment.

2.  You can navigate through your file system using the dashboard to
    locate and access your files.

### Step 4: Open the HW1 File

1.  Navigate to your "Download" folder using the Jupyter Dashboard. You
    can use the file browser within the dashboard.

2.  Look for the "Week1.zip" file or your HW1 file within the "Download"
    folder.

3.  Select the file by clicking on it. This will open a new Jupyter
    notebook or file editor for your HW1 file.

### Step 5: Rename the HW1 File

1.  Before you begin working on your HW1, it's recommended to rename the
    file to include your last name. This will help you keep your files
    organized.

    -   Right-click on the file.
    -   Select "Rename."
    -   Change the file name to "HW1\_`<Your Last Name>`{=html}."

### Step 6: Work on Your HW1

You can now work on your renamed HW1 assignment within Jupyter Notebook.
When you're done, remember to save your changes.

## Conclusion

You've successfully launched a local Jupyter server using Anaconda
Navigator, opened your renamed HW1 file, and organized your files with
your last name. Happy coding!
