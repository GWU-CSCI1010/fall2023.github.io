<!-- ## Steps -->
### Step 1: Open Anaconda Navigator

1. Search for "Anaconda Navigator" in your computer's applications or start menu.
2. Click on "Anaconda Navigator" to open it.

### Step 2: Launch Jupyter Notebook

1. In Anaconda Navigator, locate the "Jupyter Notebook" tile and click the "Launch" button next to it. This will launch a local Jupyter server on your computer.

### Step 3: Access Jupyter Dashboard

1. After the Jupyter server has started, your default web browser will open with the Jupyter Dashboard. This dashboard is a web-based interface to your Jupyter environment.

2. You can navigate through your file system using the dashboard to locate and access your files.

### Step 1: Open the HW1 File

1. Navigate to your "Download" folder using the Jupyter Dashboard. You can use the file browser within the dashboard.
2. If asked to allow terminal access to the Download folder, click on "Allow"

2. Look for the HW1 file within the "Download" folder.

3. Select the file by clicking on it. This will open a new Jupyter notebook or file editor for your HW1 file.

### Step 2: Rename the HW File

1. Before you begin working on your HW, it's necessay to rename the file to include your last name. This is how you're expected to turn in your HW files.

   - Right-click on the file.
   - Select "Rename."
   - Change the file name to "HW1_\<Your Last Name>."

### Step 3: Work on Your HW

You can now work on your renamed HW assignment within Jupyter Notebook. When you're done, remember to save your changes.

You've successfully launched a local Jupyter server using Anaconda Navigator, opened the HW1 file, and renamed files with your last name. Happy coding!
