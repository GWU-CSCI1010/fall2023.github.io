## Step 3: Manually Unzip the ZIP File

### For Mac Users

1. Locate the downloaded **Week3.zip** file. It should be in your "**Downloads**" folder.
2. Double-click on the **Week3.zip** file to unzip it.
3. This will create a "**Week3**" folder inside which you can find the .ipynb and .csv files along with the "HW2.ipynb" file.

## Step 4: Access Course Files with Anaconda

Now that you have successfully unzipped the course materials, let's access them using Anaconda Jupyter:

1. Open Anaconda Navigator, you must already have it installed on your computer. If not, please install Anaconda Navigator following the [installation guide](install-editor.qmd#select-an-option-appropriate-for-your-operating-system).
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook from Anaconda Navigator.
3. Navigate to the "**Week3**" folder where you unzipped the ZIP file.
4. Access the course files, which should include .ipynb and .csv files for the exercises. To understand how to work with the HW files, refer to [this guide](homework.qmd#working-with-HW.ipynb).
