The course will introduce the students to basics, emerging concepts, and applications of Computer Science, to computing and modeling using Python and projects using Raspberry Pi (Model: 4B). Course will consist of\n\nlectures on the various disciplines in Computer Science,\nhands-on Python programming exercises and\nhands-on exercises and in-class projects using Raspberry Pi 4B single-board computer.\n\nThe students will work on the following two engineering innovation projects:\n\nGuided-python programming project and\nWill have the option of choosing a final Raspberry Pi 4B-based project or a python programming project to address an impending need in engineering-innovation\n\nThrough the above course activities students will be exposed to computing, technical resources and presentations on various aspects in the field of computer science. The students will get access to a “slack-workspace” for this course, that will facilitate offline discussions among themselves and the instruction team. The students will also be provided lecture presentationsand video summaries whenever possible and made available on the course webpage and / or blackboard.\n\n\n\nThis is a Quarto website.
